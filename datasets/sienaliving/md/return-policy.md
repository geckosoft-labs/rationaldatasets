## **Return windows**

* **Standard change-of-mind:** 30 days from delivery.

* **EU/EEA & UK statutory withdrawal:** 14 days from delivery—no reason needed. If we didn’t inform you of this right, the period extends by 12 months. ([Centro Europeo dei Consumatori](https://www.europe-consommateurs.eu/en/shopping-internet/14-days-to-withdraw.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/summary/consumer-information-right-of-withdrawal-and-other-consumer-rights.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## **What’s returnable (condition)**

* Unused, unmodified items, in original packaging where possible. You may handle goods only as needed to check them; **we may deduct for diminished value** caused by use beyond that.

## **Not returnable (unless faulty)**

* **Custom/personalized/made-to-order** (e.g., custom sizes/finishes, COM upholstery). ([Legislation.gov.uk](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eudr/2011/83/article/16/data.xht?view=snippet&wrap=true&utm_source=chatgpt.com))

* Digital gift cards.

## **How to start a return**

1. Submit a request at \[Return Portal URL\] or email \[returns@yourdomain.com\] within the applicable window.

2. We’ll give you packing and pickup/label instructions.

3. **Bulky items:** we can arrange carrier pickup. You’ll see the pickup cost before we schedule it.

## **Return shipping costs**

* **Change-of-mind returns:** you cover return shipping (we can deduct our arranged pickup cost from your refund). In the EU/UK this applies only if we told you upfront—this policy is that notice.

* **Defective/damaged or wrong item sent:** we cover return shipping or offer repair/replacement.

## **Refunds**

* **EU/EEA & UK withdrawals:** we refund **all payments incl. standard delivery**, within **14 days** of your withdrawal notice; we may **withhold** until we get the goods back or you provide proof of return.

* **Everywhere else:** refunds issued after the item is received and inspected.

* Refund method: original payment method. Taxes/duties paid to authorities are usually non-refundable; ask your local customs.

## **Exchanges**

* Fastest route: return the item, place a new order. For defects, we’ll repair/replace where possible.

## **Damage on delivery**

* If packaging is visibly damaged, note it with the carrier. Report transit damage with photos to \[support@yourdomain.com\] **within 48 hours** of delivery so we can file claims and sort replacement/pickup.

## **Order cancellations (pre-shipment)**

* Cancel free before dispatch. After dispatch, use the return process.

## **Warranties (EU/EEA/UK)**

* Purchases come with a **minimum 2-year legal guarantee** against lack of conformity. We’ll repair, replace, or refund as required. ([European Union](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/shopping/guarantees-returns/index_en.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Rete dei Centri Europei dei Consumatori](https://www.eccnet.eu/consumer-rights/what-are-my-consumer-rights/shopping-rights/guarantees-and-warranties?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## **Region specifics (legal bits we must say)**

* **EU/EEA & UK:**

  * 14-day right to withdraw from distance purchases; exceptions include **custom/personalized** goods and certain sealed hygiene items once unsealed. ([EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX%3A32011L0083), [Legislation.gov.uk](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eudr/2011/83/article/16/data.xht?view=snippet&wrap=true&utm_source=chatgpt.com))

  * You must send goods back within **14 days** of withdrawal. ([EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX%3A32011L0083&utm_source=chatgpt.com))

  * If the item was delivered during an off-premises sale and **can’t be returned by post**, the trader must collect (off-premises only).

* **Rest of world:** our 30-day policy applies unless local mandatory rules give you more—if so, those rules win.

## **Practical packing rules**

* Use original packaging where possible and re-box to protect hard corners/finishes. Missing or heavily damaged packaging may increase “diminished value” deductions (EU) or lead to denial (outside EU).
